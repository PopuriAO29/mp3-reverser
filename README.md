# 3pm: Online MP3 Reverser

3pm is a simple web app which lets you upload your mp3 files and reverse them, so that you can listen to them backwards.

> Why would I want to do that?
 
Well, maybe you wonder what your favourite song sounds like when played backwards? Or you are looking for hidden messages in old rock music or political speeches? Or perhaps you just like strange noises and weird voices. Do you really need a reason?
