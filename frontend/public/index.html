                    <h2>What is 3pm?</h2>
                    <p>3pm is a free online service that allows you to listen to your MP3 music and voice files in reverse.</p>
                    <p><em>"Why would I want to do that?"</em> you ask?</p>
                    <p>Well, maybe you wonder what your favourite song sounds like when played backwards? Or you are looking for hidden messages in old rock music or political speeches? Or perhaps you just like strange noises and weird voices. Do you really need a reason?</p>
                    <p>In any case, simply click the button above to get started. The maximum file size is 20Mb and the supported file formats are <em>mp3</em>, <em>ogg,</em> and <em>wav</em>.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy!</p>

                    <h2>What is "Stereo Shift"?</h2>
                    <p>"Stereo Shift" will shift the left and right channel of your music file by 2 beats. Works best with music that has a good and steady beat, best enjoyed using headphones. Give it a try.</p>
